-- Farmer Registry reporting layer
-- =============================================================================
-- Flattens the register into wide, indexed materialized views that dashboards
-- (Superset) read from. Charts then stay simple SELECTs instead of repeating
-- multi-table joins and JSONB digging in every chart definition.
--
-- Grain differs from NSR, deliberately
-- ------------------------------------
-- NSR pairs household/individual. Farmer's shape is a three-level tree:
--
--     farmer ──< land ──< crop / livestock / farm_inputs
--            └──< membership_details, score
--
-- Crops, livestock and inputs hang off the LAND PARCEL, not the farmer (verified
-- against the seed set: 392/392 crops, 317/317 livestock and 434/434 input rows
-- link to a land id, 0 to a farmer id). So there are two views, at the two grains
-- that answer real questions:
--
--   fr_rpt_farmer — one row per farmer, everything rolled up. "How many farmers
--                   irrigate?", "cluster membership by region", "livestock heads
--                   per farmer".
--   fr_rpt_land   — one row per parcel. "Area by tenure", "crop mix", "land use".
--                   Area questions MUST use this view: rolling area to the farmer
--                   and then charting it double-counts nothing, but slicing by a
--                   parcel attribute (tenure, use) only makes sense per parcel.
--
-- Country-agnostic by construction
-- --------------------------------
-- Geography is unpacked from geo_code_hierarchy_json BY POSITION (ordinality),
-- never by level name. A deployment with country/region/district/ward/village and
-- one with region/zone/woreda/kebele both populate geo_1..geo_n in their own
-- order, and `fr_rpt_geo_levels` carries that deployment's actual level labels so
-- a dashboard can title the columns correctly. Nothing here assumes a country, a
-- level naming scheme, or a fixed depth.
--
-- Areas are normalised to hectares
-- --------------------------------
-- land_size is a free-text column and unit is an enum, so the raw pair cannot be
-- summed. land_size_ha is the only column charts should aggregate; the raw pair is
-- carried alongside for drill-down. A non-numeric land_size yields NULL rather
-- than failing the refresh — bad data must not take the dashboards down.
--
-- Materialized, not plain views: the JSONB unpacking over a bulk-loaded register
-- is far too slow to run per chart. Refresh after a load, LAND FIRST — fr_rpt_farmer
-- reads fr_rpt_land, so refreshing the farmer view against a stale land view
-- publishes stale holdings:
--
--   REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW CONCURRENTLY fr_rpt_land;
--   REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW CONCURRENTLY fr_rpt_farmer;
--
-- fr_rpt_crop is GENERATED now, from reporting.yaml, and is refreshed with the
-- rest — the refresh job resolves its order from pg_depend, so it still lands
-- after the land view it reads.
--
-- (CONCURRENTLY needs the unique indexes created at the bottom, and those in turn
-- need a first non-concurrent refresh — which CREATE ... AS does for us.)
-- =============================================================================

-- fr_rpt_geo_levels is GENERATED, from Master Data.
--
-- It used to be derived here, by unpacking a registered farmer's own hierarchy.
-- That made the labels a property of the DATA: a registry installed empty — the
-- production case — produced an empty lookup, so nothing could name its own geo
-- columns. Master Data holds the country pack and knows the answer before the
-- first record exists.

-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Land parcels
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Built first: fr_rpt_farmer rolls its per-farmer aggregates off the same CTEs.
