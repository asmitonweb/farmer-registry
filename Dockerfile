# Farmer Registry unified build definition.
#
# This is one Dockerfile with independent runtime targets. The application is
# still a Compose stack: each target keeps the upstream entrypoint, runtime,
# lifecycle, and least-privilege dependency set required by that component.
# Build every target through `docker compose build`, or select one directly
# with `docker build --target <target> ...`.

# Fixes for bugs the pinned platform ships: async/await mismatches in
# registry-core, and iam_core's permission lookup, which asks IAM by bare role
# name and so takes another registry's same-named roles on a shared IAM. See
# the script for what each patch fixes and why. Applied in every stage that
# installs registry-core, since they all ship the same packages (a patch whose
# file is absent from a stage is skipped).
