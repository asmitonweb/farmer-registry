    """Make intake submission reads resolve the farmer photo into a URL.

    The platform builds intake section payloads with _serialize_model, which
    emits mapped columns only. record_image_url is not a column -- it exists
    solely as a presigned URL added at read time -- so a photo captured during
    intake comes back as a bare document_id and every consumer that renders a
    picture gets nothing to render.

    That is what makes the farmer photo invisible on the approval screen
    (/tasks/intake-form/<register>/<submission_id>): it renders the same intake
    sections, and the photo section's header-section widget draws ``imageUrl``
    only (zz_farmer_photo_section.sql). The same blank shows when a saved photo
    section is reopened on a draft, for the same reason.

    Every register-side read path resolves these keys already --
    G2PRegisterService, G2PRegisterHierarchicalService, and for the detail
    view's edit flow G2PRegisterChangeRequestService, which does exactly this
    over its change payloads. The intake read path is the one that was missed,
    so this restores parity rather than inventing a convention.

    WHY WRAP THE CLASS AND NOT SUBCLASS IT
    --------------------------------------
    Registering a G2PIntakeFormDataService subclass does not work.
    BaseComponent.get_component returns the FIRST registered instance that
    isinstance-matches, and openg2p_registry_staff_api.main constructs
    CoreInitializer() -- which builds the platform's own instance -- before
    ExtensionsInitializer(). A subclass registered from this extension always
    lands second and nothing ever resolves to it. Wrapping the methods on the
    class instead applies to whichever instance wins that race.

    Idempotent: the extension Initializer can run more than once per process.
    Raises rather than silently doing nothing if a reader is gone, so an
    RP_VERSION bump that renames one surfaces at startup instead of as a
    photo that quietly stops appearing.
