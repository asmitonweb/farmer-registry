"""Single source of truth for the farmer-intake field rules (G2R-47, gaps G2/G3).

``widget-data-validation`` in the register metadata is enforced by the browser
only -- ``ui-widgets/src/utils/validation.ts`` runs it as the staff types. Every
other way a record reaches the register (bulk file import, the partner API,
ingestion) never loads that metadata, so a rule expressed only in the seed SQL
is not a rule about the data, just a rule about one UI.

This module restates those rules in Python so the domain services can apply them
on every path. The regexes are deliberately byte-identical to the metadata ones:
``tests/test_validation_rules_match_metadata.py`` reads the seed SQL and fails if
the two ever drift, which is the failure mode that actually matters -- a form
that accepts what the server rejects, or the reverse.

Rule provenance is the Gen1-parity decision signed off on G2R-26: replicate what
Gen1 enforced, not what would be nicer than Gen1.
