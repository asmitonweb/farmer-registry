          auto-added presigned URL on read, per
          G2PRegisterService/G2PRegisterHierarchicalService, and isn't a real

          intake form's photo section (zz_farmer_photo_section.sql) go this
          way — the intake section reuses that same widget for its picker.
        - Any 'file' widget bound straight to record_image_document_id writes
          the blob into a text column instead of a real document reference —
          the same trap the Land certificate upload normalizes in
          _persist_embedded_certificate. The intake photo section was built
